>Our Bayesian Negative Sampling algothrim does not depend on the datasets. Just split the dataset you are interested in into the training set and test set, replace the train.csv and test.csv files, you can run Bayesian negative sampling easily. You just need to make sure that you have chosen appropriate prior information for **modeling prior probability** $P_{TN}(\cdot)$ or $P_{FN}(\cdot)$.
